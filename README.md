# Views Auto-Refresh

A module to refresh a view after a specified time interval. 

Includes advanced options to avoid reloading the whole page, and to avoid
causing a full Backdrop bootstrap at each refresh.

The easiest way to use this module is to add a Header of type
"Global: Autorefresh" to your view via Views UI.
